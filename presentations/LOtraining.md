# Legal Observer Training

## National Lawyers Guild

## North Carolina Chapter


*** 

# The National Lawyers Guild

Founded in 1937 as the nation’s first racially integrated bar association.

Involved in many landmark cases and activities integral in building the grassroots movements necessary to protect civil liberties and human rights.

*** 

# NLG Legal Observer (LO) Program

- Established in 1968
- Designed to enable people to express their political views as fully as possible without unconstitutional disruption
- Part of a comprehensive system of legal support designed to enable people to express their political views as fully as possible without unconstitutional disruption

*** 

## Who Are Legal Observers?

- Typically, but not exclusively, law students, legal workers, and lawyers who may or may not be licensed locally
- Open to everyone willing to be trained and respect the free space created by the program
- The Legal Observe Program is not open to those working for or with government or law enforcement agencies

*** 

## What LOs Do 

Observe and document police conduct at demonostrations

- To deter violations of constitutional rights and other misconduct by police 
- To assist lawyers representing participants facing criminal charges or bringing civil suits

*** 

## What LOs Don't Do

- Crowd control
- Speak to the Media
- Interfere with arrests
- Provoke action
- Negotiate with police on behalf of protestors
- Provide direct legal advice to protestors or engage in the unauthorized practice of law
- Get arrested! (Hopefully)


***

## Confidentiality of LO Material 

- Treat all information obtained while serving as a LO is confidential
- Information may be protected as attorney work-product
	- Material created or compiled by an attorney or someone working for them in anticipation of or preparation for legal representation
	- Often (but not always) there will be an attorney (usually not on site) designated for this purpose
- **Immediately** inform the LO coordinator & attorney(s) if you receive a subpoena or other legal process related to your work as an LO

*** 

## LOs and Law Enforcement 

- LO’s are not “arrest-proof”
	- LOs are subject to the same laws and police orders (e.g. orders to disperse) as any other person on the scene
- Law enforcement is going to do what law enforcement is going to do, whether it’s legal/constitutional or not
	- Although rare, legal observers have been arrested at recent demonstrations and in the past
- Photographing and recording law enforcement is generally legal
	- This does not mean that law enforcement will not threaten to arrest you for doing so

*** 

# LO Team & Coordination 

*** 

## LO Team

The LO team for a demonstration will ideally include: 

- Off-Site Legal Hub 
- On-Site LO Coordinator  
- Other LOs 

***

## LO Team 

The size and organization of the LO team may vary depending on size & location of action, number of LOs available, and other factors

- For small events or last-minute requests, you may be the only LO on site. In such cases, be sure to have someone off-site you can contact if needed

*** 

## LO Communitation 

- The on-site Coordinator maintains communication with the off-site Legal Hub 
- The on-site Coordinator and other LOs typically communicate using Signal
	- The Coordinator should set-up a Signal group in advance for this purpose

*** 

# LO Preparations

*** 

## Prior to Day of Action

- LO Coordinator will contact you and other legal observers (usually through a Signal group set up for the action)
- LO Coordinator will establish a time and place to meet at the action
	- Depending on the location and nature of the action (e.g. if it will include a march), it may be helpful to have maps of the area
- Gather the equipment you'll need for the action (green hat, notepads, pencils/pens, etc.)
	- If you do not have an LO green hat, let the Coordinator know and they should arrange for you to have one at the action

*** 

## Day of Action

- Check in with the on-site Coordinator or off-site Contact
- Locate other LOs
- If there are sufficient LOs present, organize into pairs. 
- Deploy LOs (in pairs or individually) around the location for effective observation
	- Depending on the site and nature of the action, LOs may need to move to cover the area or in response to police activity
	- Use Signal to communicate your location or a need for more LOs in a particular area

*** 

# What to Bring 

- Green NLG Legal Observer hat
- Notepad (pocket-sized) and pencils/pens

# Know What to Watch For 

*** 

## Review “Know Your Rights” Materials

- [www.nlg.org](http://www.nlg.org/)
- [www.civil-rights.net](http://www.civil-rights.net/)

*** 

## Be Familiar With Applicable Law 

- Past cases involving police misconduct and civil rights violations specific to your jurisdiction.
- Potentially unconstitutional police tactics.
	- “Pop-up” police lines, denial of access to public forum, intimidating displays of force, etc. 
- Potential criminal charges & defenses 
	- Common charges: Disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, etc. 
	- Potential defenses: First Amendment defenses, justification, *de minimis* infractions, self defense, defense of others, etc.
- Local municipal code 
	- Rules for signs, permit requirements, etc. 

*** 

# What to Document 

***

## Law Enforcement Present

- City, County, State, Federal, Private security, etc.
	- If you're not sure, try to get photos or videos of uniform/vehicle insignia
- Officer names and badge numbers, especially of those of higher ranks 
- Chain of command: who appears to be in charge?
- Locations and numbers of vehicles 
	- Squad cars, unmarked vehicles, busses, vans, motorcycles, bicycles, horses, etc.
- Weapons & Other Equipment
	- LRADs, flexi-cuffs, batons, tasers, tear gas, riot gear, etc.

***

## Other Information 

- Location of action, route of march
- Number of participants
- Media present (may be useful for lawyers later on)
- Counter-demonstrators present 
	- Generally avoid taking photos or videos, except for interactions with police or aggression toward/interference with those you are observing for

*** 

# Documenting Arrests

*** 

## Information About Those Arrested 

- Name & date of birth (if possible)
	- If you can't get names, note description (appearance, clothing, etc.)
- Injuries 

## Police Conduct 

- Identity and agency of arresting officer(s) 
- Use of force/weapons 
- Warnings given prior to arrest

*** 

# Documenting Other Law Enforcement Conduct 

- Orders to disperse
- Restrictions on demonstrator movement 
	- Preventing access to public forum (park, plaza, sidewalks)
	- Pop-up lines: Misdirecting demonstrators, splitting demonstrators up, or detaining/arresting segments.
	- Kettling: Corraling demonstrators in location with no ability to leave 
- Displays of force 
	- Banging on riot shields; aiming pepper spray; thumping batons; verbal threats
- Use of weapons/equipment against demonstrators 
	- Firing guns or "less than lethal" rounds; tasers; tear gas/pepper spray; LRAD ("sound cannon"); batons, bicycles, or other objects used to hit demonstrators
- Assaults on demonstrators
	- Punching, kicking, shoving, choke holds, etc. 

*** 

# Interacting with Police

In most cases, there will be no need to interact or communicate directly with the police. 

Communication with police may be required to ascertain information about police orders, arrests, etc. 

When speaking with police, remain calm and non-argumentative. 


*** 

# Phones & Recording Devices

*** 

## Smartphone Use 

- Turn off cloud back-up (Google drive, etc.)
- Disable fingerprint unlocking and enable password

***

## Audio/Visual Recording

- Wide-angle shots are often more useful than close-ups
- Record short “snippet” videos rather than one long one
- Try to record audio during arrests
- Include date and time stamps for all photos & videos (should be a setting in your app) 
- **Do not post anything on social media**

*** 

## Security & Privacy 

- Avoid recording demonstrators engaged in behavior that could be construed as illegal
- Never record demonstrators who don’t want to be recorded.
 	- If someone asks not to be recorded, honor that request to the extent possible. 
- _Do not post any photos, videos, or accounts of the action to social media_ or share with anyone other than the legal team or legal observer coordinator
	- This is essential to maintain the integrity of the LO program and to preserve any assertion of attorney work product privilege against disclosure

*** 

# Some Common Scenarios 

*** 

## Scenario 1: Planned Civil Disobedience

- Try to get names and dates-of-birth of those planning to be arrested ahead of time
- Notify on-site LO Coordinator or off-site Legal Hub immediately of planned civil disobedience if they are not already aware
- Count total number of participants arrested 
- Try to find out where they are being taken and any charges

*** 

## Scenario 2: Mass Arrest

- To the extent possible, try to avoid being arrested yourself. 
	- You are not useful as an LO if you are arrested. 
- Before effecting a mass arrest, _police are supposed to give at least one warning_, indicating how long people have to disperse before arrests will commence. 
- Document this warning:
	- Time(s) it is given and repeated
	- Exact wording
	- Manner of delivery (e.g. shouted, bullhorn, etc.) and audibility 
	- Any other orders given 
- If you _don’t_ hear this kind of warning before there are mass arrests, make a note of that fact. 

*** 

## Signs That a Mass Arrest May Be Imminent 

- Flexicuffs
- Pop-up Lines: Misdirecting demonstrators, splitting demonstrators up, or detaining/arresting segments.
- Kettling: Police lines that prevents people from joining or leaving a demonstration
- Police from other agencies suddenly appear in large numbers
- Empty buses arrive with no route on the from banner


*** 

# After the Action

- The on-site LO Coordinator or another NLG member will collect all notes, photos, videos, etc. from the action
- You should also keep copies of your notes, photos, videos, etc. on your personal computer or a flash drive in case they are needed. 
	- Do not back up or store on insecure cloud services (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) 
- There may also be a follow-up (by phone, Zoom, etc.) to debrief. 
- In case of arrests or a civil action on behalf of demonstrators, lawyers representing demonstrators may communicate with you as a potential witness.
